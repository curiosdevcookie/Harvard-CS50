Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
That it'll stay the same as the previous predictions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 
I would say not even 1000000 simulations is good enough.
